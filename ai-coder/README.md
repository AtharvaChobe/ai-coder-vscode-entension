# Spring AI Coder

üöÄ **Spring AI Coder** is a VS Code extension that helps you generate **Spring Boot code** (controllers, services, models, configs, etc.) using AI.  
Unlike other code generators, it understands your **open project context** (up to 3 active files) so the generated code integrates smoothly with your existing project.
